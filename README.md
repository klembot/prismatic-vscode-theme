# Prismatic

This is a theme for Visual Studio Code that takes [Prism.js]'s default color
scheme as direct inspiration, though it differs from it in a few ways. It
includes a dark version that is derived from the light version instead of using
Prism's default dark theme, as that doesn't highlight everything that the light
theme does. There's also an "void" version designed for low-light environments.

See the preview of this on [vscodethemes.com](https://vscodethemes.com/e/cklimas.prismatic).
